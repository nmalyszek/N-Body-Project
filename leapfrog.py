def updateParticles(masses, positions, velocities, delta_time):
    """
        Evolve particles in time via leap-frog integrator scheme.

        This function takes masses, positions, velocities, and a
        time step (delta_time), calculates the next position and
        velocity, and then returns the updated (next) particle
        positions and velocities.

        Parameters
        ----------
        masses : np.ndarray
            1D array containing masses for all particles in kg.
            Its length is the number of particles (AKA "N").

        positions : np.ndarray
            2D array containing (x, y, z) positions for each particle.
            Shape is (N, 3) where N is the number of particles.

        velocities : np.ndarray
            2D array containing (x, y, z) velocities for each particle.
            Shape is (N, 3) where N is the number of particles.

        delta_time : float
            Evolve system for time delta_time in seconds.

        Returns
        -------
        updated positions and velocities : (2D positions np.array, 2D velocities np.array)
            Each being a 2D array with shape (N, 3), where N is the
            number of particles.
