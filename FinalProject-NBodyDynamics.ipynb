To earn full credit, this draft *does not* need to be complete or polished. It merely needs to demonstrate serious effort has been made. If you don't have code written for some section, you *must* briefly write out (in human words) your plan for how to approach it, some pseudo-code, some question you would like answered about it, or where you are stuck. I will provide feedback/assistance within a couple of days, if appropriate. As long as you have `embed=True` in any video display commands in your notebook, you can turn in JUST your notebook HTML file for your project draft.\n",

    "Your task is to write a gravitational $N$-body code: a program that evolves a system of $N$ particles over time, accounting for their mutual gravitational forces. Starting from initial arrays of particle masses, positions, and velocities, your code will need to step through many time points and calculate the instaneous accelerations, velocities, and positions of the particles at these times. At each time, your code must calculate the vector forces among all $N$ particles, use those forces to determine the instantaneous accelerations, update both the velocities and positions of the particles, store those values, and then repeat this process over and over again for every time point. This may sound daunting, but don't worry!  You will be given a module to do the physics for you and you can break the rest down into smaller steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is designed to synthesize many of the topics we have covered in class. For the project, you will use variables, functions, loops, arrays, file input/output, plotting, and more. You will need to tie multiple concepts together to get through it: a good strategy throughout is to make sure you are *very* clear on what each aspect of the code should do, and test each component to make sure they work in isolation, before linking them all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some parts of the project build off of earlier ones, but some can be completed in isolation. If you get stuck on one part, keep going; you may be able to finish later parts of the project. As with other assignments, you should feel free to discuss with other students, but you must turn in your own work.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the provided python modules, you will either need to (*Anaconda folks:*) download them and place them in your working directory (or in your `$PYTHONPATH`) or (*JupyterHub folks:*) add the appropriate directory to your path as done in previous tutorials and homeworks."

    "Numerically, we can approximate these integrals by breaking them up into discrete time steps. If we make these steps small enough, then we should get a fairly accurate approximation to how positions and velocities change with time.
