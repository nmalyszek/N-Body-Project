Here is a project that I made for my astronomy-based programming class. This project calculates acceleration due to gravity on n bodies and then numerically integrates to update their position over time. To test different planets, modify the kepler16.txt and change the masses or initial positions/velocities. If you would like to create an MP4 file of the orbits, you need to download ffmpeg to the environment on which you are running the code on. If you are using Anaconda like I did, use "conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg" in the Anaconda prompt. You can also install it directly on your computer if you go to https://ffmpeg.org/download.html.
